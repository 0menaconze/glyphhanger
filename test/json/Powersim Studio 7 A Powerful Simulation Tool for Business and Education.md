Some of the features of Powersim Studio 7 are:
 
- New possibilities for ranges make working with arrays easier. You can use dynamic ranges to add elements to an array, share element names among enumeration ranges, and use free-text element names in enumeration ranges[^2^].
- Four new statistical functions for normal and triangular distributions, and three new functions that return ranges for the time series of corresponding series variables[^2^].
- Support for shortcuts to variables not present in the same diagram[^2^]. This allows you to reuse components and collaborate with your colleagues more easily.
- The new database dataset allows you to connect to any relational database, setting up the connection is supported by a wizard[^2^]. You can also connect to Microsoft Excel through the Excel dataset or use a drag and drop into Studio using the XLDATA function[^2^].
- Run optimization, risk analysis and risk management and share your results with, and even allow for input by, the end user[^2^]. You can also use the RUNRANGE function to get a dimension that corresponds to all runs[^2^].
- Password protection on several levels to keep your models confidential[^2^].
- Action buttons give the end user ability to act upon events in a simulation[^2^].
- Build models with 6-dimensional arrays and input as much as 2.5 million elements per variable[^2^].
- Function library with more than 200 functions[^2^].
- Series variables is a new concept, allowing time series of data to be expressed and calculated before the simulation starts[^2^].
- The Visual Basic function allows you to define your own functions not supported by Studio[^2^].
- Unit control lets all variables have a related unit. Studio control that you express your equations correctly in respect to units[^2^].
- Working in a multi-national company? Choose a new language, define descriptive texts and you have a multi-lingual model view while the model's equations stay the same[^2^].
- Build models with continuous, discrete and now also instant calculations (series variables) using graphical stock-and-flow diagrams[^2^].
- Run your simulations making reference curves and rewind the simulation back to a cue point when making an unfortunate decision[^2^].
