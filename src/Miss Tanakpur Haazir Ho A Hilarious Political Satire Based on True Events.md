The film is set in a village of Haryana, where Sualaal Gandas (Annu Kapoor) is the head and a wealthy but impotent chauvinist. He married the much younger Maya (Hrishita Bhatt), who falls in love with Arjun (Rahul Bagga), a village youth. Sualaal suspects Maya's affair but cannot prove it. One day, he catches them red-handed and decides to frame Arjun in a rape case of his buffalo "Miss Tanakpur", who had won the beauty pageant for buffaloes in the local fair. He bribes the police and the witnesses to register the case and torture Arjun. Arjun's family suffers humiliation and tragedy as a result of this false accusation. The court orders the prosecution to present the victim, Miss Tanakpur, but Sualaal had sold her before filing the case. He manages to locate her and bring her to the court, but she is not the same buffalo as mentioned in the FIR. The judge is annoyed and chides the prosecutor. Sualaal then announces that as a form of penance, Arjun must marry Miss Tanakpur.
